> Most enterprises stall in pilot purgatory. Scripts break, tools don’t scale, and progress stalls.
I cut through the noise by building agent workflows tailored to your business, shipped production-ready with governance and SLAs. Faster cycles, lower costs, and better experiences, delivered securely inside your systems.

### Philosophy

> "Build with AI, not around it." I design systems where agents are first-class builders, not helpers. My focus is on execution, composability, and making powerful AI tooling practical to run and own.

<details>
<summary>Random Facts</summary>

* Treat AI agents as autonomous coworkers, not chatbots
* Regularly run multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel inside isolated micro VMs
* Enjoy turning messy systems into clean runbooks
* Background spans blockchain, infra, and applied AI
* CTO energy, but happiest hands-on
* Tea first, architecture second
